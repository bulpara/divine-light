## What Is This?

Divine Light is a single-page interactive website containing curated Quranic verses, Prophetic du'ās, and stories organized around a specific theme: **how to carry ambition, vision, and worldly success as a Muslim without losing your soul.**

This isn't a generic Quran app. It's a focused daily reading built for a specific person — the Muslim entrepreneur, developer, creator, or builder who feels a fire inside them and wants to make sure that fire serves both worlds.

## Why I Built This

The world currently knows Muslims through two lenses: victims who need help, or threats. Both are false. Both erase 1,400 years of civilizational excellence.

I built this because I needed a daily anchor — something to read every morning that keeps my intention aligned while I build. I couldn't find anything that spoke to the intersection of **ambition + taqwa + modern entrepreneurship**, so I made it.

Then I realized: if I need this, others do too.

## Sections

| Section | What It Covers |
|---|---|
| **Daily Du'ā** | The Prophet's ﷺ refuge from useless knowledge and an arrogant heart — with Arabic text, translation, and personal reflection |
| **Inner Light** | Quranic verses on the nūr Allah places in believers' hearts (An-Nur 24:35, Al-Hadid 57:28, Al-An'am 6:122, Ash-Shura 42:52) |
| **Spiritual Insight** | Firāsa, Furqān, the primordial covenant, and the Al-Kahf warning about wasted effort |
| **Prophetic Stories** | Yusuf (AS) and the power of a young man's dream, Musa (AS) learning humility from Khidr, Ibrahim (AS) and the search for certainty |
| **The Umar Model** | Build empires with your hands, keep your heart on the ground — the standard for the ambitious believer |
| **The Sulayman Strategy** | Visible excellence as da'wah — the Queen of Sheba effect, Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf's entrepreneurship, and the Sulayman vs Qarun firewall |
| **Daily Check** | Morning intention reset + evening reflection checklist to keep your niyyah clean |

## The Core Ideas

**1. Inner light is real.** The Quran explicitly describes a nūr that Allah places in believers' hearts — a light by which they walk, see, and navigate the world differently. (Surah An-Nur 24:35)

**2. Ambition is not the enemy.** The Prophet ﷺ said: *"Work, for everyone is facilitated toward that which he was created for."* High aspiration (himma) is a praiseworthy quality in Islam.

**3. Visible excellence is da'wah.** The Queen of Sheba didn't convert from a lecture — she converted from witnessing the undeniable excellence of Sulayman's kingdom. (Surah An-Naml 27:44)

**4. The firewall is one sentence.** Sulayman said *"هَٰذَا مِن فَضْلِ رَبِّي"* — "This is from the favor of my Lord." Qarun said "I earned this myself." Same wealth. Opposite endings.

**5. The Umar standard.** Conquer half the world. Sleep on a dirt floor. Empires with your hands, heart on the ground.

## Tech Stack

Intentionally minimal:

- Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies
- Single file (`divine-light.html`)
- Google Fonts: Cormorant Garamond, Amiri, Noto Naskh Arabic
- Fully responsive
- Works offline once loaded

This was a deliberate choice. A spiritual reading tool shouldn't require `npm install`. Just open the file.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/divine-light.git

# Open it
open divine-light.html
```

That's it. No build step. No dependencies. No configuration.

## A Note on Authenticity

This project is unapologetically Islamic. The content is not watered down, secularized, or made "palatable" for a general audience. It's built by a Muslim, for Muslims, with the Quran and Sunnah as its foundation.

That said — if you're not Muslim and you're reading this, you're welcome here. The Quran itself says: *"To each We extend — to these and to those — from the gift of your Lord. And never has the gift of your Lord been restricted."* (Surah Al-Isra 17:20)

## Sadaqah Jariyah

The Prophet ﷺ said: *"When a person dies, their deeds end except for three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for them."* (Sahih Muslim)

Every person who reads a verse from this project, every developer who forks it and shares it, every Muslim who finds their morning anchor here — that reward continues. Open source meets sadaqah jariyah.

If this helped you, the best thing you can do is share it with one other person who needs it.

MIT — maximum reach, no friction. Take it, fork it, translate it, make it yours.
